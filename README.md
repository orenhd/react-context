# react-context

A [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) demonstrating a simple state management implementation, using React [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

The featured functionality is similar to the one presented on [react-typescript--redux](https://github.com/orenhd/react-typescript--redux).

### Notable Additions
- Basic logic and snapshots unit testing, using Jest and [Enzyme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enzyme).
